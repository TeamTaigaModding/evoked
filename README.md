This mod adds three features.

1. Evokers drop Life Runes instead of Totems of Undying.
2. When you use a Totem of Undying, it'll turn into a Totem Husk. You can recharge Totem Husks by crafting them with LifeÂ  Runes.
3. Totem Husks are added to chests in Woodland Mansions.

Combined, these three features gates Totems behind Woodland Mansions while maintaining their current gameplay in an immersive manner.
